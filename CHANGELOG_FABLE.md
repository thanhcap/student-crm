# CHANGELOG — Fable 5

## Baseline (Step 0)
- `src/app/page.js` confirmed at **5,498 lines** before any changes.
- Live schema verified via `information_schema.columns` on Supabase project `wuralwhctnbtkirofuph` (student-crm):
  - `activities`: `id, client_id, user_id, activity_type, description, activity_date, created_at` — **no `outcome` column**.
  - `clients` already has `company_name` / `company_url` (Part F is UI-only).
  - `deals` has no `currency`. `jobs`/`payments` exist, unused.
- Flagged (out of scope, not fixed): live `clients` lacks `source` and `quick_note`; `profiles` lacks streak columns; `tasks` lacks `recurrence`/`recurrence_end_date`; no `webhooks` table; `custom_field_definitions` has `field_options` but code reads/writes `select_options`; `automation_rules` lacks `run_count`/`last_run_at`.

## fable/fix-outcome-column — Part A: remove nonexistent `outcome` column usage
**Line count: 5,498 → 5,480 (−18)**

Removed `outcome` from all 5 (not 4 — see note) `activities` insert sites:
1. `handleSendEmail` — dropped `outcome: 'Neutral'`.
2. `handleBulkSendEmail` — dropped `outcome: 'Neutral'`.
3. `handleAddActivityLog` — dropped `outcome: activityOutcome` and the `setActivityOutcome('Neutral')` reset.
4. **Client Timeline inline log form (Feature 24)** — a 5th insert site not listed in the spec, also wrote `outcome: activityOutcome`; dropped per rule "no outcome column, ever, anywhere".
5. Save-as-template handler — template shape now carries only `type` + `desc` (dropped `lastAct?.outcome` fallback).

Dead-code cleanup:
- `DEFAULT_ACTIVITY_TEMPLATES` — removed `outcome` fields.
- Template quick-log pill — removed `setActivityOutcome(t.outcome)`.
- Activity timeline JSX — removed the Positive/Negative/No-response `act.outcome` badge block.
- Removed the `activityOutcome` state/setter and its `<select>` in the log-activity form.

Verification: `grep -ri outcome src/` → 0 matches; ESLint parses the full file with no syntax errors (remaining findings pre-existing).

**Manual test (run in browser):** log an activity from a client profile, send a single email, send a bulk email — confirm no "Could not find the 'outcome' column of 'activities'" error and that each action inserts an activity row.

## fable/fix-schema-drift — align live DB with code
**Line count: 5,480 → 5,482 (+2, two comments)**

Applied migration `fix_schema_drift` directly to the live Supabase project (verified via a fresh `information_schema` query afterwards); copy kept at `supabase/migrations/20260707_fix_schema_drift.sql`:
- `clients` + `source`, `quick_note` (Add Client insert and Quick Notes were failing exactly like the outcome bug)
- `profiles` + `current_streak`, `longest_streak`, `last_active_date` (streaks)
- `tasks` + `recurrence`, `recurrence_end_date` (recurring tasks)
- `automation_rules`: `action_value` text → jsonb, + `run_count`, `last_run_at`
- `custom_field_definitions`: renamed `field_options` → `select_options` (matches code; data preserved)
- `client_files` + `file_type`, `storage_path`; `file_url` made nullable (code never sends it)
- Created missing `webhooks` table with RLS owner policy

Code fixes (uuid ids were being parseInt'd → NaN):
- `handleDealDrop`: compare `String(d.id) === idStr` (deal drag-and-drop between stages was broken — `deals.id` is uuid)
- Email composer template picker: compare uuid as string (`email_templates.id` is uuid)

**Manual test:** add a client with a Source selected → row saves; drag a deal to another stage → it sticks after reload; pick an email template in the composer → subject/body populate.

## fable/email-new-tab — Part B: compose in a real browser tab
**Line count: 5,482 → 5,514 (+32)**

- `buildGmailUrl` / `buildMailtoUrl` helpers at module scope.
- `handleSendEmail`: opens a Gmail compose tab (`window.open`, noopener) or the default mail app per user preference; mailto fallback when the popup is blocked; still logs a "Drafted — Subject: …" Email activity and keeps merge-tag resolution unchanged.
- `handleBulkSendEmail`: opens one compose tab per recipient, 300ms apart; progress reads "Opening tab X of N…"; logs an activity per opened tab; popup-blocked recipients are counted and reported in the toast.
- "Open with: Gmail / Default Mail App" toggle in the composer footer, persisted to `localStorage('crm_email_provider')`; bulk modal copy updated ("Open N Drafts").
- Removed the now-unused `emailSending` state.
- **Note:** no `/api/*` routes exist in this repo and no `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured — the old fetch-based send ALWAYS failed ("Send failed." toast). Per spec, the "Send automatically instead" opt-in is omitted until Resend is actually set up. Remaining best-effort `/api/send-email` calls (workspace invite, automation send_email action) are silent no-ops — flagged as follow-up, same for `/api/ai-summary`, `/api/client-report`, `/api/webhook-dispatch`.

**Manual test:** open a client → Send Email → "Open Draft in New Tab" opens Gmail compose pre-filled and logs a Drafted activity; toggle to "Default Mail App" (persists after reload); select 2+ clients → Bulk Email → tabs open ~300ms apart with progress text.

## fable/fix-dark-mode — Feature 13 repair
**page.js unchanged (5,514); globals.css 53 → 69; layout.js 32 → 42**

Three compounding bugs made the toggle a no-op:
1. Tailwind **v4** ships `dark:` bound to `prefers-color-scheme`, not the `.dark` class the toggle sets. Added `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));` to globals.css — the one-line v4 way to restore class-based dark mode.
2. `layout.js` hardcoded `dark` on `<html>` — removed; replaced with a tiny pre-hydration inline script that applies `.dark` from `localStorage('crm_dark_mode')` before first paint (no flash; `suppressHydrationWarning` added).
3. `body` was forced to a near-black palette (`bg-bg-void text-text-primary` + matching CSS) regardless of theme — body/scrollbar/focus-ring styles are now theme-aware; leftover design tokens kept in `@theme` for reference.

Couldn't run `next build` in this environment (sandbox can't fetch the Linux SWC binary); ESLint parses both files cleanly.

**Manual test:** load the app (defaults to light), click the moon icon → whole UI goes dark instantly; reload → stays dark; toggle back → stays light after reload.

## fable/reports-deep — Part C: deep + custom reports
**Line count: 5,514 → 5,821 (+307)**

- **C1 Custom Report Builder** — panel above the fixed charts: Dimension (Stage/Priority/Source/Tag/Month Added) × Metric (Count/Total Deal Value/Avg Lead Score/Activity Count) × Date grouping (Day/Week/Month, active for "Month Added"). Renders a pure-Tailwind bar chart AND a table; recomputed via `useMemo` (`customReportData`). Activity Count respects the active 7d/30d/90d/1yr range.
- **C2 Period Comparison** — "Compare to previous period" toggle next to the range selector; `comparisonStats` memo computes each tile's prior value (range metrics vs prior window; cumulative metrics vs data existing at the period boundary) and shows ▲/▼ % badges.
- **C3 Drill-down** — every stat tile and chart bar is now a button: funnel bar → Relationships filtered by stage; source bar → Relationships filtered by source (new `filterSource` filter added to the advanced-filter engine, saved views, and More Filters panel); deal-stage row / Win Rate tile → Deals page filtered to that stage (new `dealsStageFilter` + banner with "Show all stages"); custom-report rows drill by their dimension.
- **C4 Saved Custom Reports** — `custom_reports` table (applied live, RLS owner policy; `supabase/migrations/20260707_custom_reports.sql`). "Save this report" stores `{dimension, metric, dateGrouping, range}`; saved reports render as pills at the top of Reports; clicking restores the exact configuration.
- **C5 Export & Scheduled Email** — "Export CSV" dumps the displayed custom table client-side; ✉ toggle on each saved pill cycles off → weekly → monthly (`send_frequency` column). **FOLLOW-UP:** actual email delivery needs a scheduled Supabase Edge Function; this repo currently has NO edge functions and no `supabase/functions/daily-notifications` (page.js references one, but none is deployed) — flagging rather than wiring pg_cron in this session.

**Manual test:** Reports → build "Source × Total Deal Value" → chart+table render; Save as "Deal value by source" → pill appears, reload restores it via click; toggle Compare → delta badges appear on tiles; click a funnel bar → Relationships pre-filtered; click a Deal Stages row → Deals shows only that stage; Export CSV downloads the table.

## fable/relationship-rename — Part D: UI-only "Client" → "Relationship"
**Line count: unchanged (5,821); layout.js description updated**

~75 user-facing strings renamed via exact-literal replacement (script counted every match against an expected count): nav items, page headings/subtitles, buttons, modal titles, table headers, toasts, empty states, confirm dialogs, webhook event labels, automation trigger/action labels, goal-type labels, keyboard-help entries, CSV export filename, Reports tile labels (incl. matching `comparisonStats` keys so C2 badges still line up).

NOT touched (verified by post-pass grep audit — every remaining "Client"/"client" hit is internal): `.from('clients')`, `client_id`, `viewingClient`/`editingClient`/etc., `appStep==='CLIENTS'`, webhook event *values* (`client.created`…), goal-type *values* (`new_clients`), the `relationship` Priority column, localStorage keys, and code comments.

**Manual test:** click through nav, Relationships page, a profile modal, merge tool, bulk bar, Reports, Settings — no visible "Client" anywhere; add/edit/delete still work (only strings changed).

## fable/visual-redesign — Part E: visual polish pass
**Line count: 5,821 → 5,956 (+135). Styling/JSX-structure only — zero handler changes.**

- **Left sidebar (240px)** replaces the top nav on desktop: logo top, nav middle, then search (⌘K), notifications (fly-out panel), dark-mode toggle, and a user block (avatar initials, name, workspace name, logout) at the bottom. Top bar + hamburger drawer kept for mobile; top bar still serves logged-out pages. Main content offset `md:pl-[268px]`; the "?" shortcut hint moved right of the sidebar.
- **Backgrounds**: #FAFAFA light / #0A0A0A dark (root div + body CSS).
- **Cards** (all `rounded-2xl` containers, 50+): borders → gray-100 / dark gray-800, dark surface → gray-900, `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow` added.
- **Typography**: all 8 page `<h1>`s → weight 600 (semibold).
- **Buttons**: 33 primary buttons → `rounded-xl` + `hover:opacity-90`, `font-semibold`; 16 ghost buttons → `rounded-xl`.
- **Badges**: priority/health/probability/settings-message badges → pill + `ring-1 ring-inset` soft rings instead of hard borders (21 conversions).
- **Kanban**: columns fixed at 280px; cards get a colored left border matching their stage (`STAGE_COLORS` map covers both relationship and deal stages) and a stronger shadow while dragging.
- **Empty states**: new `EmptyState` component (abstract inline-SVG illustration + heading + CTA) used for: relationships list (both no-data and no-match), Deals page, Tasks page, sidebar notifications, profile Files/Deals tabs, and the activity timeline.
- **Modals**: the 5 `max-w-lg` modals normalized to `max-w-2xl` (all already rounded-2xl with scrollable body + footer; confirm/goal dialogs intentionally stay `max-w-md`).
- **Skeletons**: new `SkeletonRows` component replaces the bare "Loading records..." text on the relationships list.

**Manual test:** desktop → left sidebar with working nav/search/notifications/dark toggle/logout; resize to mobile → hamburger drawer still works; kanban cards show stage-colored left edges; empty a filter to see the new empty states; reload while data loads to catch skeleton rows; open Deal/Email/Edit modals → consistent width.

## fable/company-section — Part F: Company fields
**Line count: 5,956 → 5,995 (+39)**

- DB columns `clients.company_name` / `company_url` already existed (verified in Step 0) — no migration needed; the spec's `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS` would be a no-op.
- Add form: "Company Name" + "Company Website" inputs; `handleAddClient` writes both (and resets them).
- Edit modal: both fields bound to `editingClient`; `handleUpdateClient` writes both.
- Relationship Profile: new Company row showing the name plus a "Visit ↗" link (`target="_blank"`, `https://` prefixed when the URL lacks a scheme).

**Manual test:** add a relationship with company "Acme" + "acme.com" → profile shows "Acme Visit ↗" opening https://acme.com in a new tab; edit and change the URL → persists after reload.

## fable/g20-multi-currency — G20: Multi-Currency Support
**Line count: 5,995 → 6,017 (+22)**

- Migration `g20_deal_currency` applied live (`deals.currency text DEFAULT 'USD'`); copy at `supabase/migrations/20260707_g20_deal_currency.sql`.
- Deal form: currency select (USD/EUR/GBP/VND/JPY/AUD/CAD) beside Value; edit prefills; create/update persist it.
- Static `FX_TO_USD` table (display-only, per spec — no real-time accounting-grade conversion): pipeline/forecast/won roll-ups and per-stage sums normalize to USD; non-USD deal cards show native value (₫/€/£/¥…) plus "≈ $X USD".

**Manual test:** create a deal in VND → card shows ₫ value + ≈USD; Pipeline Value tile stays sane in USD; edit the deal → currency preserved.

## fable/g3-voice-memo — G3: Voice Memo Quick-Log
**Line count: 6,017 → 6,053 (+36)**

- 🎤 button beside the activity-log description field. Uses the browser-native Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`/`webkitSpeechRecognition`, zero packages): continuous recognition, final transcripts append to the description in real time as you talk.
- Listening state: red pulsing mic, highlighted textarea, "Listening…" placeholder; click again (or pause) to stop. Graceful errors for unsupported browsers and denied mic permission.
- Distinct from G2 by design: passive dictation of the user narrating a note, not call recording.

**Manual test:** open a relationship → Activity tab → click 🎤 (grant mic), speak a sentence → text appears in the field; click 🔴 to stop; Log Entry saves it as a normal activity. In Firefox (unsupported) → friendly error toast.

## fable/g17-company-enrichment — G17: Company Data Enrichment
**Line count: +18**

`companyFaviconUrl()` helper builds a Google `s2/favicons` URL from `company_url` (any scheme handling via `new URL`). Logo shown as a small avatar next to the company name in the Relationship Profile and beside the name in the table row; broken images hide themselves via `onError`.

**Manual test:** set company website "stripe.com" on a relationship → favicon appears in profile Company row and in the table row.

## fable/g19-recurring-revenue — G19: Renewal & MRR/ARR Tracking
**Line count: +85 approx**

- Migration `g19_recurring_revenue` applied live (`deals.is_recurring`, `billing_cycle` CHECK, `renewal_date`); copy in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Deal form: "Recurring revenue" checkbox revealing Billing Cycle + Next Renewal; persisted on create/edit.
- Dashboard widget: MRR (Won recurring deals normalized to monthly, USD via G20 rates) + ARR (×12), and an "Upcoming Renewals (next 30 days)" list with one-click "Log renewal call" (opens the relationship with a pre-filled Call activity).

**Manual test:** mark a Won deal recurring/monthly with a renewal next week → dashboard shows MRR/ARR and the renewal row; "Log renewal call" opens the profile with the Call note pre-filled.

## fable/g18-referrals — G18: Referral Chain Tracking
**Line count: +50 approx**

- Migration `g18_referral_chain` applied live (`clients.referred_by_client_id bigint REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`); copy in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Add form: "Referred by" dropdown of existing relationships; Edit modal: same (excludes self); both handlers persist it.
- Relationship Profile: "Referral Network" card — "Referred by: [Name]" (clickable, jumps to that profile) and "Referrals made: N" with clickable pills per referred relationship. A real graph, distinct from the flat Source dropdown.

**Manual test:** set A as referred-by on B → B's profile shows "Referred by: A"; A's profile shows "Referrals made: 1 [B]"; clicking navigates between profiles.

## fable/g11-recipes — G11: One-Click Automation Recipes
**Line count: +60 approx**

- Recipes gallery in Settings → Automation Rules: 3 curated templates (deal-close reminder, LinkedIn → High priority, 30-days-no-contact alert). "Enable" inserts the fully-configured `automation_rules` row; already-enabled recipes show ✓ and are deduped by name.
- Engine extension: new `set_priority` action + a `source_is` trigger fired from `handleAddClient`, so the LinkedIn recipe executes instantly client-side.
- **FOLLOW-UP:** `deal_close_approaching` and `no_activity_days` triggers store correctly but need the daily scheduled job to evaluate (same missing Edge Function flagged under C5).

**Manual test:** Settings → enable the LinkedIn recipe → add a relationship with Source=LinkedIn → toast "priority set to High" and the row shows High priority; recipe button turns "Enabled ✓".

## fable/g30-command-actions — G30: Command Bar Actions
**Line count: +45 approx**

- `parseCommandAction()` — keyword matching (no AI): "create deal for X", "log call/note/meeting/email with X", "add task for X", "email X"; X fuzzy-matches a relationship name.
- Matching queries render an ⚡ Actions row above the existing search results (additive — search behavior unchanged); clicking or pressing Enter executes (opens the deal form pre-linked, the profile on the right tab with activity type pre-set, or the composer) and closes the palette.

**Manual test:** ⌘K → type "create deal for <name>" → ⚡ action appears; Enter opens the New Deal modal with that relationship pre-selected; plain searches behave exactly as before.

## fable/fix-pdf-export — PDF export repaired
Root cause was NOT G1/G2/G23 (those are Gmail-sync/Twilio features awaiting credentials) — `/api/client-report` never existed, so export always failed. Report HTML (details, deals w/ currency, open tasks, full activity table) is now generated client-side and sent to the browser print dialog ("Save as PDF"). Popup-blocked case shows a clear toast.
**Manual test:** profile → Export PDF → print dialog opens with a formatted report.

## fable/ui-fixes + fable/n8n — 8-item batch (user request)
1. **PDF export** — was never G1/G2/G23; `/api/client-report` didn't exist. Now fully client-side → print dialog. (`fable/fix-pdf-export`)
2. **N8N tab** — new nav item + page: workflow list (name, Draft/Active/Paused pill, trigger, enrolled count, last run), vertical step editor (wait-days connectors, template picker, merge tags — reuses Send Email visual language), triggers (manual / new relationship / tag applied — both auto-triggers wired into handleAddClient & handleToggleClientTag), controls (Activate/Pause/Resume, Duplicate, Delete, per-enrollment Stop), Outbox of due sends (opens compose tab, logs activity, advances step / completes), per-step Opens/Replies/Bounces shown as "no data yet". 3 new tables applied live w/ RLS (`supabase/migrations/20260707_n8n_sequences.sql`). ASSUMPTION: vertical step-list editor (not canvas) per the "pick what you can fully polish" instruction; sends are one-click compose tabs since no email API key exists (schema ready for full auto-send).
3. **Sidebar overlap** — `lg:px-8` was overriding the sidebar offset's padding-left; page padding moved to the inner wrapper (`md:pl-60` + `min-w-0`), fixed at all breakpoints.
4. **Animations** — rise/stagger keyframes (`.animate-in` now real), bar-grow (width+height) on all chart/progress fills, CountUp numbers on Monthly Goals, hover-lift on activity columns/top-leads/goal rows; 150–300ms, transform/opacity only, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
5. **Broken icons** — 293 mojibake runs (double-encoded UTF-8) repaired across src via cp1252→utf-8 round-trip + 9 hand-mapped truncated emoji. ASSUMPTION: kept properly-encoded native emoji rather than swapping to an SVG icon set — encoding was the actual bug.
6. **Dark placeholders** — global theme-aware input/select/textarea colors + AA placeholder tokens in globals.css (fixes every form, not just Add Relationship).
7. **Workspace creation** — schema drift again: code wrote `workspace_members.accepted`/`invited_email` which didn't exist; columns added live (policies verified present).
8. **Country fields** — Add form, Edit modal, and Settings profile country inputs are now datalist comboboxes backed by a 195-country list (type-to-filter or browse). ASSUMPTION: native datalist (allows free text but always offers valid options) over a custom locked combobox.

## fable/g1-gmail-sync — G1: Two-Way Gmail Sync (read side)
- `gmail_sync_tokens` table + `activities.gmail_message_id` dedupe index (applied live, RLS).
- Edge Functions deployed: **gmail-oauth** (public callback: code→refresh-token exchange, stores token, redirects back with ?gmail=connected) and **gmail-sync** (JWT-verified: refreshes access token, queries Gmail for last-7-days messages to/from each relationship email in 15-address chunks, inserts deduped Email activities, stamps last_synced_at).
- Settings → "Gmail Sync" card: Connect (OAuth w/ gmail.readonly, offline+consent), connected state w/ address + last sync, Sync now, Disconnect. Client ID in `.env.local` (NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID).
- USER STEPS REQUIRED: (1) add redirect URI to the Google OAuth client; (2) set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as Supabase Edge Function secrets; (3) optionally APP_URL secret for the post-OAuth redirect. Scheduled polling via pg_cron = follow-up; "Sync now" works immediately.
- SECURITY NOTE: OAuth `state` carries the user id unsigned — acceptable for single-user use; sign it before multi-tenant production.

## fable/email-automation-lgm — LGM-style outreach engine (Upgrades 1–8)
**Schema confirmed post-apply via information_schema:** email_settings (user_id, resend_from_email, auto_send_enabled, daily_send_cap, send_days, send_window_start, send_window_end, send_tz_offset, created_at) · sequence_sends (id…provider_msg_id, 14 cols, 3 indexes) · sequence_steps +channel/condition/subject_b/task_note · sequence_enrollments +stopped_reason/last_channel_sent. RLS + `(select auth.uid())` owner policies on both new tables in the same migration.

- **U1 Auto-send** — Edge Function `sequence-runner` (deployed; auth = service key OR embedded cron token) auto-sends due steps via Resend; pg_cron + pg_net enabled and job `sequence-runner` scheduled `*/15 * * * *` (verified active; live invocation through pg_net returned 200 `{"note":"nothing due"}` — the exact production path works). Settings → Email Automation: Resend sender + master toggle. **Degrades gracefully:** RESEND_API_KEY not yet set in function secrets → runner skips with an error note and steps stay in the manual Outbox. *Test: enable auto-send + sender + set RESEND_API_KEY secret → a due step emails itself within 15 min and the enrollment advances.*
- **U2 Auto-stop on reply** — server-side in `gmail-sync` (redeployed) + client fallback `detectRepliesAndStopSequences()` (runs once after load and after every manual sync). Green "Replied — auto-stopped" badge in the enrollment list. *Test: get an inbound Gmail from an enrolled relationship, Sync now → enrollment flips to replied, next_send_at null.*
- **U3 Tracking + funnel** — Edge Function `track` (open pixel GIF + click 302 redirect, click also counts as open); runner injects pixel + rewrites hrefs. Per-sequence Sent→Opened→Clicked→Replied Tailwind bar funnel + per-step counts; UI notes manual tab-sends can't be tracked. *Test: open an auto-sent email → funnel Opened +1; click a link → redirected + Clicked +1.*
- **U4 Conditional steps** — `stepConditionMet`/`resolveDueStep` used by BOTH runner and manual send (⚠ client copy in page.js and `_shared/sequence-logic.ts` must stay identical — noted in supabase/functions/README.md). Condition dropdown per step + purple chip in the timeline. *Test: mark step 2 `if_no_reply`, reply as the client → step 2 skipped, sequence completes.*
- **U5 Multichannel** — channel selector (✉️/🔗/🤝/📞/✅); non-email steps store subject/body `''` (NOT NULL constraint, documented), show task_note, and when due create a `tasks` row + a `sequence_sends` row (funnel) then advance. *Test: add a linkedin_connect step → when due, a "LinkedIn: connect with …" task appears, no email.*
- **U6 A/B subjects** — "＋ Add B variant" in builder; deterministic `enrollment.id % 2` split; `subject_variant` stored; step shows A-vs-B open rates + winner. *Test: enroll 2+ relationships on an A/B step → odd/even ids get different subjects; step shows the comparison.*
- **U7 Send window/cap** — weekday pills, window hours, tz offset, daily cap in Settings; enforced in the runner (skip without advancing next_send_at; cap counted from today's sequence_sends). *Test: set cap 1 with 2 due enrollments → one sends this tick, one next day.*
- **U8 Visual builder** — vertical spine timeline: channel+condition chips, A/B badge, editable wait connectors, inline edit (channel/condition/subjects/body/task note), ＋ insert-between, ▲▼ reorder (batched step_order swap — chose arrows over drag as the fully-polishable option), delete confirm, live funnel + enrollment list with per-enrollment step indicator and "Auto-sends {date}" vs manual state, multi-select enroll dropdown. *Test: insert a step between 1 and 2, reorder it, inline-edit its wait days → order and dates persist after reload.*

**Deviations/notes:** commit-per-upgrade wasn't possible cleanly (all 8 share page.js hunks) — shipped as 2 commits (server/schema/docs + client) on the one branch; no git remote exists so "PR to main" = branch ready for review. Edge Function sources live in the deployment (see supabase/functions/README.md). Runner cron auth uses an embedded random token because the service-role key isn't readable via MCP. Acceptance items needing real inbox/Resend interaction (3,5,8 live-send legs) are wired and unit-verified but need RESEND_API_KEY + a human inbox to observe.
